# TensorFlow visualization with Guild AI

Guild AI is an open source project released under the Apache 2.0
license that streamlines TensorFlow development and provides a dynamic
visual interface for monitoring and evaluating model trainings. Guild
AI simplifies complex operations to simple commands, provides
immediate feedback on training progress, and lets you compare model
performance at-a-glance. In this presentation, Garrett Smith, project
lead for Guild AI, will walk through Guild's features and architecture
and demonstrate how Guild fits within TensorFlow developer and team
work flow.

## Notes

### Roadmap

#### Enhanced visualization

E.g. visualizing layers, etc.

#### Run analysis with intelligent diffing

Plugins that provide higher level insight.

#### Component and plugin exchange with TensorBoard

Efforts from one side should apply to the other where possible.

#### Open science + open source + open results

Ability to publish results to a Depot where you can compare what
others are seeing for the same model.
